These requirements motivate the organisations' structure, their relationships to other organisations, the location of their operations and their entry into new markets. Because the nature of knowledge requirements varies by service sector, as do the organisations' structure and location, studies are necessary to explore the nature of these contingent relationships. An international and interdisciplinary team of leading academics examines the special attributes of knowledge acquisition and diffusion within and across organisations, and the consequent roles that these structurally important firms and institutions play in regional economic development.</p>",http://amzn.com/0754648974,978-0754648970,2006-12-30 00:00,,Ashgate Publising Company,"Aldershot, UK",,,Location: Suzzallo and Allen Libraries Stacks - HD9999.I492 K46 2006,,,FALSE,,James,W.,Harrington,,jwh@u.washington.edu,University of Washington - Tacoma Campus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/urban_books/1,6424841,urban_books,1421883007New Economic Spaces: New Economic Geographies (Dynamics of Economic Space),book,"<p>As a core volume in the ""Dynamics of Economic Space"" series, contributors from North America, Australasia, Europe and the Middle East each address the constitutive processes of new economic and institutional spaces and the theoretical, methodological and policy-engaging practices of emerging economic geographies.

She examines these new urban employees, who were deemed vital to the success of the global city in China, and who hoped for social mobility, a satisfying career, and perhaps a family.

The book specifically explores Seattle within the wider space-economy and multi-scaled policy regime of the Puget Sound region as a whole, ‘jumping up’ from questions of city politics to concerns with what the book interprets as the “intercurrence” of city-regional “ordering."" These theoretical terms capture the state-progressive effort to promote smarter forms of regional development but also the societal/institutional tensions and outright contradictions that such urban development invariably entails, particularly around problems of social equity. Key organizing themes in the text include: the historical path-dependencies of uneven economic and social development, particularly between Tacoma-Pierce County and Seattle-King County; current patterns of high-wage, medium-wage, and low-wage jobs; the emerging spatial and social structure of recent residential changes, especially with respect to class and race composition; and, finally, transit trends and new urban spaces associated with policy efforts to mitigate highway congestion and car-dependency. Greater Seattle, then, is mapped as a key US urban region inscribed spatially by the uneven search for a more sustainable order. Historically-sensitive, theoretically-informed and empirically topical, this book is of interest to scholars and students at all levels in regional planning, urban geography, political science, sustainability studies, urban sociology and public policy.</p>",http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319544472,978-3-319-54448-9,2017-01-01 00:00,,Springer,"New York, NY",,,,,,,,Yonn,,Dierwechter,,yonn@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/urban_books/22,9987314,urban_books,1491514692
