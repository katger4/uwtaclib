We offer our kids a weak and poorly thought out curriculum; too many teachers do not make good use of classroom time and follow lesson plans that are superficial and repetitive; almost all state governments define “proficiency” at low levels of competency; and because kids with very uneven skills populate a classroom, teachers spend considerable time on review before introducing new material. This dismal picture is tempered by the fact that the hard work and dedication of countless teachers and administrators means that many students get an excellent education. But it doesn’t temper it much. As a group, even our top students are not as strong as are those in a large majority of other rich countries.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be this way. Katherine Baird, an economist, starts by clearly spelling out how our educational system is trapped in mediocrity. Yet, she doesn’t just expose where we are. She identifies the steps to get out of the trap. We need to (1) dramatically reform our education’s governance structure, (2) establish high expectations for all students, (3) provide adequate support to meet those expectations, and (4) introduce strong incentives for students to work hard in school so they do their part in meeting higher standards. Clearly, it isn’t as simple as it sounds, but Baird carefully examines each factor that has led to the current state in education and then spells out how a combination of policies will weaken the forces that keep our schools mediocre and instead make them ones worth copying</p>","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71124282720001451""><strong>Print copy in UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - LA217.2 .B33 2012</strong></a></p>",http://www4.bookstore.washington.edu/_trade/ShowTitleUBS2.taf?ActionArg=Title&ISBN=9781442215474&SKU=7499069&sdb=ALL,2012-08-09 00:00,,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,"Lanham, MD",,Economics; Education,,9781442215474,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71178479540001451,Katherine,,Baird,,kebaird@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/1,3670612,ias_books,1475281474"Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King's Last Campaign",book,"<p>The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.'s last crusade.</p><p>Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic ""plantation mentality"" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty.

Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history.</p><p>The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America's racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.</p>",,http://www.amazon.com/Black-Workers-Remember-Segregation-Unionism/dp/0520232054,1999-01-01 00:00,,University of California Press,Berkeley,,African American Studies; Labor Relations; Oral History; United States History,"Location: UW Tacoma Library Stacks - HD8081.A65 H66 1999",0520217748,,,FALSE,,,Michael,K,Honey,,mhoney@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/2,3670724,ias_books,1475281461Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers,book,"<p>Widely praised when it was first published and now considered a classic by many, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights chronicles the southern industrial union movement from the Great Depression to the cold war, a history that created the context for the sanitation workers' strike that brought Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to Memphis in April 1968.

As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King's prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today.

Way Up North in Louisville explores the forces that led blacks to move to urban centers in the South to make their homes. Adams defines ""home"" as a commitment to life in the South that fueled the emergence of a more cohesive sense of urban community and enabled southern blacks to maintain their ties to the South as a place of personal identity, family, and community. This commitment to the South energized the rise of a more militant movement for full citizenship rights and respect for the humanity of black people.</p><p>Way Up North in Louisville offers a powerful reinterpretation of the modern civil rights movement and of the transformations in black urban life within the interrelated contexts of migration, work, and urban renewal, which spurred the fight against residential segregation and economic inequality. While acknowledging the destructive downside of emerging postindustrialism for African Americans in the Jim Crow South, Adams concludes that persistent patterns of economic and racial inequality did not rob black people of their capacity to act in their own interests.</p>","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71153273370001451""><strong>Location: UW Tacoma Faculty Publications - F459.L89 N427 2010 </strong></a></p>",http://amzn.com/080783422X,2010-11-25 00:00,,University of North Carolina Press,Chapel Hill,,,Location: UW Tacoma Library Stacks - F459.L89 N427 2010 ,978-0807834220,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71240607670001451,Luther,,Adams,,adamsl@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/6,4313282,ias_books,1475281476Rodeo Cowboys in the North American Imagination,book,"<p>Rodeo is an enduring relic of America’s popular culture, drawing capacity audiences to all its venues, from small western cowtowns to Madison Square Garden. The rodeo cowboy, that figure of rugged independence and solitary courage, continues to evoke the spirit of a vanished frontier and the hardy pioneers who conquered it. In this study historian Michael Allen examines the image of the rodeo cowboy and the role this image has played in popular culture over the past century. He sees rodeo as a significant American folk festival and the rodeo cowboy as the avatar of a nearly extinct authentic figure, the “real cowboy,” who embodies the skills and values of traditional western rural culture. Allen’s analysis explores the evolution of the myth of the rodeo man and its subsequent institutionalization and acculturation into the media of popular culture. He also examines the impact on this myth of significant changes in the rodeo milieu—the commercialization of the event and the professionalization of rodeo performers; the arrival on the rodeo scene of performers from outside the white, male, western, rural origins of the traditional cowboy performers. He discovers that America’s—and indeed the world’s—fascination with the rodeo cowboy reflects feelings far deeper than a taste for exciting entertainment. Allen’s discussion of the archetypal figure of the rodeo cowboy will change forever our perception of rodeo, but it will also help us understand how the ancient tension between frontier and civilization continues to play a role in our national imagination.</p>",,http://amzn.com/0874173159,1998-09-01 00:00,,University of Nevada Press,Reno,,,Location: UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - GV1834 .A55 1998,978-0874173154,,,FALSE,,,Mike,,Allen,,magician@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/7,4313283,ias_books,1475281467A Patriot's History of the United States: from Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror,book,"<p>For the past three decades, many history professors have allowed their biases to distort the way America’s past is taught.

Michael Allen explores the rigorous lives of professional boatmen who plied non-steam vessels—flatboats, keelboats, and rafts—on the Ohio and lower Mississippi rivers from 1763-1861.</p><p>Allen first considers the mythical “half horse, half alligator” boatmen who were an integral part of the folklore of the time. Americans of the Jacksonian and pre-Civil War period perceived the rivermen as hard-drinking, straight-shooting adventurers on the frontier. Their notions were reinforced by romanticized portrayals of the boatmen in songs, paintings, newspaper humor, and literature. Allen contends that these mythical depictions of the boatmen were a reflection of the yearnings of an industrializing people for what they thought to be a simpler time.</p><p>Allen demonstrates, however, that the actual lives of the rivermen little resembled their portrayals in popular culture. Drawing on more than eighty firsthand accounts—ranging from a short letter to a four-volume memoir—he provides a rounded view of the boatmen that reveals the lonely, dangerous nature of their profession. He also discusses the social and economic aspects of their lives, such as their cargoes, the river towns they visited, and the impact on their lives of the steamboat and advancing civilization.</p><p>Allen’s comprehensive, highly informative study sheds new light on a group of men who played an important role in the development of the trans-Appalachian West and the ways in which their lives were transformed into one of the enduring themes of American folk culture.</p>",,http://amzn.com/0807115614,1994-04-01 00:00,,Louisiana State Press,Baton Rouge,,,Location: UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - F517 .A39 1990 ,978-0807115619,,,FALSE,,,Mike,,Allen,,magician@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/9,4313285,ias_books,1475281472The Patriot's History Reader: Essential Documents for Every American,book,"<p>An original collection of the most influential documents in American history, from the bestselling authors of A Patriot's History of the United States.

Upon arriving in Seattle, however, Velasco learned that the 'American Dream' hardly applied to dark-skinned immigrants. Devalued by the workforce and spurned by white women, the disillusioned Velasco became involved in Filipino activities, but never conceded his place in American society. Amongst other achievements, he published poetry in nearly a dozen mainstream anthologies on American literature. Ultimately, by the end of the Second World War, Velasco had learned to approach his Caucasian relationships with more circumspection, and also began to experience intra-ethnic conflicts with other Filipinos.

Although it is a far cry from reality, the fantasy of a perfect suburban life still exists in the collective imagination of millions of Americans. This dream of suburban perfection is built around a variety of such ideologically conservative values and ideals as the importance of tradition, the centrality of the nuclear family, the desire for a community of like-minded neighbors, the need for clearly defined gender roles, and the belief that with hard work and determination, anyone can succeed.</p><p>Building on the relationships between suburban life and American identity, Look Closer examines and interprets recent narratives that challenge the suburban ideal to reveal how directors and producers are mobilizing the spaces of suburbia to tell new kinds of stories about America. David R. Coon argues that the myth of suburban perfection, popularized by postwar sitcoms and advertisements, continues to symbolize a range of intensely debated issues related to tradition, family, gender, race, and citizenship. Through close examinations of such films as American Beauty, The Truman Show, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith as well as such television series as Desperate Housewives, Weeds, and Big Love, the book demonstrates how suburbia is used to critique the ideologies that underpin the suburban American Dream.</p>","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71190940950001451""><strong>Print copy in UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - Call Number: PN1995.9.S74 C66 2014</strong></a></p>",http://amzn.com/0813562074,2013-11-01 00:00,,Rutgers University Press,,,,,978-0813562070,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:uw:CP71193738630001451,David,,Coon,,drcoon@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/25,4524538,ias_books,1477615842Modern Power and Free Speech: Contemporary Culture and Issues of Equality,book,"<p>Modern Power and Free Speech explores the complicated relationship between the First Amendment and culturally disempowered and groups within the United States.

Lacking a consensus on definition, critics often describe the fantastic as supernatural, or similar to, but quite different from fantasy, science fiction, and magical realism. In Unraveling the Real Cynthia Duncan provides a new theoretical framework for discussing how the fantastic explores both metaphysical and socially relevant themes in Spanish American fictions. Duncan deftly shows how authors and artists have used this literary genre to convey marginalized voices as well as critique colonialism, racism, sexism, and classism. Selecting examples from the works of such noted writers as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortazar, and Carlos Fuentes, among others, she shows how capacious the concept is, and why it eludes standard definition. Challenging the notion that the fantastic is escapist in nature, Unraveling the Real shows how the fantastic has been politically engaged throughout the twentieth century, often questioning what is real or unreal. Presenting a mirror image of reality, the fantastic does not promote a utopian parallel universe but rather challenges the way we think about the world around us and the cultural legacy of colonialism.</p>",,http://amzn.com/1439902410,2010-11-28 00:00,,Temple University Press,"Philadelphia, PA",,,Location: Suzzallo and Allen Libraries Stacks - PQ7082.F35 D86 2010,978-1439902417,,,FALSE,,,Cynthia,,Duncan,,cyduncan@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/28,4524541,ias_books,1475281466Worlds Apart: Why Poverty Persists in Rural America,book,"<p>In this compelling book, Cynthia Duncan examines the nature of poverty by listening to the stories of real people in remote rural areas of the United States.

In the media landscapes of today, conglomerates jockey for primacy and the internet increasingly places media in the hands of individuals-producing the range of phenomena from movie blockbuster to YouTube aesthetics. Media forms and genres are proliferating and interpenetrating, from movies, music and other entertainments streaming on computers and iPods to video games and wireless phones. The audiovisual environment of everyday life, too-from street to stadium to classroom-would at times be hardly recognizable to the mid-twentieth-century subject. The Oxford Handbook of New Audiovisual Aesthetics provides powerful ways to understand these changes.</p><p>Earlier approaches tended to consider sound and music as secondary to image and narrative. These remained popular even as practices from theater, cinema and television migrated across media. However, the traversal, or ""remediation,"" from one medium to another has also provided practitioners and audiences the chance to rewrite the rules of the audiovisual contract. Whether viewed from the vantage of televised mainstream culture, the Hollywood film industry, the cinematic avant-garde, or the participatory discourses of ""cyberspace,"" audiovisual expression has changed dramatically.</p><p>The book provides a definitive cross-section of current ways of thinking about sound and image. Its authors-leading scholars and promising younger ones, audiovisual practitioners and non-academic writers (both mainstream and independent)- open the discussion on audiovisual aesthetics in new directions. Our contributors come from fields including film, visual arts, new media, cultural theory, and sound and music studies, and they draw variously from economic, political, institutional, psychoanalytic, genre-based, auteurist, internationalist, reception-focused, technological, and cultural approaches to questions concerning today's sound and image.

He also provides an explanation for the end of imperial extraterritoriality, arguing that the Western decision to abolish their separate legal systems stemmed from changes in non-Western territories, including Meiji legal reforms, Republican Turkey's legal transformation under Ataturk, and the Guomindang's legal reorganization in China.

Donald Fels and Signboard Painters of South India presents sixteen large-scale paintings that explore trade and globalization in India. Fels' conceptual starting point for this exhibition was Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's 1498 voyage to Malabar, India, in search of a direct sea route for the spice trade. What is a Trade? explores the historic and modern-day legacy of that expedition more than 500 years later. In 2004 and 2005, Fels traveled to Kerala (formerly Malabar), India, as a Fulbright Senior Research Scholar, to work with local commercial signboard painters on a body of work that examines globalization in India and traces its roots to Vasco's voyage. Most of the signboard painters had formerly worked as billboard painters -- until recently, all billboards in India were hand-painted, but cheaper and more efficient inkjet printers are making the painters obsolete. In light of this trend, Fels and his collaborators created work in the style of traditional hand-painted billboards and Bollywood advertising. The bright colors and strong graphic narratives make visually arresting statements about the historic and contemporary effects of trade and globalization.

However, all too often resulting technologies are technically usable, yet cannot be immediately put to meaningful use by users in their local, concrete contexts. Support for concrete user activities is frequently missing in design, as support for decontextualized actions is typically the focus of design. Sun examines this disconnect between action and meaning in cross-cultural technology design and presents an innovative framework, Culturally Localized User Experience (CLUE), to tackle this problem. Incorporating key concepts and methods from activity theory, British cultural studies, and rhetorical genre theory, the CLUE approach integrates action and meaning through a dialogical, cyclical design process to design technology that engages local users within culturally meaningful social practices. </p><p>Illustrated with five in-depth case studies of mobile text messaging use by college students and young professionals in American and Chinese contexts spanning years, Sun demonstrates that a technology created for culturally localized user experience mediates both instrumental practices and social meanings. She calls for a change in cross-cultural design practices from simply applying cultural conventions in design to engaging with social affordances based on a rich understanding of meaningful contextualized activity. Meanwhile, the vivid user stories at sites of technology-in-use show the power of ""user localization"" in connecting design and use, which Sun believes is essential for the success of an emerging technology like mobile messaging in an era of participatory culture.</p><p>This book will be of interest to researchers, students, practitioners, and anyone who wants to create culture-sensitive technology in this increasingly globalized world that requires advanced strategies and techniques for culturally localized, participatory design.</p>","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71197186640001451""><strong>Print copy in UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - Call Number: NK5198.T33 A4 2012</strong></a></p>",http://amzn.com/0199744769,2012-03-02 00:00,,Oxford University Press,"New York, NY",,,<p>Location: UW Tacoma Library Stacks - HM846 .S85 2012</p><p>Series: Human-Technology Interaction</p>,978-0199744763,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71230260670001451,Huatong,,Sun,,htsun@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/62,4892244,ias_books,1475281468Assessing the War on Terror,book,"<p>Was the US-led war on terror, especially the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, a necessary response to the September 11 terrorist attacks?

Common to each expression of this distrust is the often hidden premise that no knowledge or tool of knowledge, least of all language, can be trusted until an absolute justification can be provided for it. Idling the Engine examines the consequences of this skepticism as it appears in and around the work of Julio Cortázar, Franz Kafka, and James Joyce, each of whom was well aware of the crisis of language and the threat it was perceived to hold for literary endeavors like theirs. Almost as important as the study of the novels themselves is the study of their interpretation by critics, many of whom fail to question this skepticism about language because they themselves take it as axiomatic.</p><p>Author E. Joseph Sharkey uses the philosophies of language of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Ludwig Wittgenstein to counter the skepticism in question by showing that a language grounded in history instead of the transcendent is grounded nevertheless. Using Wittgenstein’s metaphor of the idling engine for the misguided search for a logical or metaphysical justification of language, Sharkey demonstrates how such ""idling"" pervades the novels of Cortázar, Kafka, and Joyce. As he does so, he argues that at their best these novels celebrate the marvelous efficacy of language and show that it is made possible precisely by virtue of the limitations that trouble the skeptics.</p>",,http://amzn.com/0813214416,2006-06-15 00:00,,Catholic University of America Press,"Washington, D.C.",,,Location: UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - PN3503 .S483 2006,978-0813214412,,,FALSE,,,E.,Joseph,Sharkey,,jsharkey@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/66,7412713,ias_books,1475281460"Frontiers of Western History: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Western History",book,,,http://amzn.com/0536021988,1999-01-01 00:00,,Simon & Schuster,"Needham Heights, MA",,,Location: UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - F591 .F76 1999,978-0536021984,,,FALSE,,,Michael,,Allen,,magician@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,Mary,L.,Hanneman,,hanneman@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/67,7412717,ias_books,1475281466"History of Jazz: Lecture Notes, Overheads, Listening Examples",book,,,http://amzn.com/0787233188,1997-01-01 00:00,,Kendall Hunt Publisting Company,"Dubuque, IA",,,Location: Odegaard Undergraduate Library Stacks - MT10 .C63 2012,978-0787233181,,,FALSE,,,Tom,,Collier,,mallets@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/68,7412719,ias_books,1475281463Understanding the Life of Point Loma,book,"<p>An easy-to-read overview of the coastal sage scrub ecosystem and nearshore marine environment of the Point Loma peninsula.

Drawing striking parallels between 'Big Food' and 'Big Pharma', Cargill shows how both industries use similar tactics to manufacture desire, resist regulation and convince us that the solution to overconsumption is further consumption. Real-life examples illustrate how loneliness, depression and lack of purpose help to drive consumption, and how this is attributed to individual failure rather than wider culture.</p><p>The first book to introduce a clinical and existential psychology perspective into the field of food studies, Cargill's interdisciplinary approach bridges the gulf between theory and practice.

Films, television shows, and news reports are saturated with images of dead female bodies, women being murdered, women who have come back from the dead, disappeared women who are presumed to be dead, and women threatened with death. Compared to earlier decades, images of dead women are much more graphic and sensationalized in these contemporary, mainstream cultural products. In this book, Clarke Dillman explains the contextual environment from which these images have arisen, how the images relate to (and sometimes contradict) the narratives they help to constitute, and the cultural work that dead women perform in visual texts. Across the visual field, the bodies of dead women have both a haunting power and a disciplining function that can be seen but not stated as such. Although many of the visual texts gesture to and acknowledge feminist gains, their use of images of dead women has the symbolic effect of forcing women's immobilization while also reaffirming constraints on women within still powerful patriarchal structures.</p>","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71211270670001451""><strong>Print copy in UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - Call Number: P94.5.W65 D55 2014</strong></a></p>",http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137457684,2014-11-26 00:00,,Palgrave MacMillan,"New York, NY","women, death, film, media",American Film Studies; American Popular Culture; American Studies; Arts and Humanities,,9781137457684,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71236199140001451,Joanne,,Clarke Dillman,,jclarked@uw.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/71,8063165,ias_books,1475281475The Video Game Business,book,"A dominant global cultural force, the video game business is diverse and increasingly influential.

Sound and timely policies can limit the current and future impact of the epidemics but good policies are built on a strong epidemiological base and according to the countries' needs. The aim of this study was to assemble all the information available on the epidemiological pattern of the epidemics in Latin America and to gather information on current national surveillance capacity, national responses of the health sector to identify key areas where specific interventions are needed. Through national statistics, data published by international organizations, and databases searches, the authors collected data on the extent, trends and patterns of HIV/AIDS epidemic in 17 Latin American countries. Data on national surveillance systems and national responses from the health sector were gathered through questionnaires applied to managers of the national HIV/AIDS surveillance system, director of the National HIV/AIDS program, NGOs, and physicians. Despite relatively high rates of HIV infection in most countries, many Latin American countries have not yet faced a full-scale AIDS epidemic. HIV/AIDS falls within the framework of a low endemic setting; in the majority of the countries the epidemic is still concentrated in high-risk populations. Latin America has the necessary infrastructure to efficiently and effectively confront the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Generations of readers internalized and shaped the ""cultures of piety"" represented by these works. Anne Clark Bartlett and Thomas H.

(The volume includes an appendix containing the original texts of the latter six pieces.) The collection illustrates the polyglottal, conflicting, and often polemical nature of devotional culture in the Middle Ages. It provides a valuable context for and interesting counterpoint to the Canterbury Tales  and other classic works of late medieval England.

Within the same text, Bartlett shows, a woman reader might be invited to identify not only with the temptress reviled by misogynistic ascetics, but simultaneously with the courtly domina, the supportive spiritual friend of the author, or with the erotic sponsa Christi. Because of the varying levels of literacy of medieval women readers, however - as well as the abundance of competing representations of those readers - the overt messages of devotional texts were interrupted and distorted. As Bartlett analyzes the complex relationship between misogynistic literature and the development of female subjectivity in the Middle Ages, she helps refute the assumption common among feminist critics that women necessarily internalize negative portrayals.</p>","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP7195813890001451""><strong>Location: UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - PR275.R4 B37 1995</strong></a></p>",http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100683570,1995-05-11 00:00,,Cornell University Press,Ithaca,,,,978-0-8014-3038-1,,,,,,Anne,Clark,Bartlett,,anne01@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/77,9225537,ias_books,1475873643Vox Mystica: Essays on Medieval Mysticism in Honor of Professor Valerie M.

This first modern biography presents an account of her extraordinary life and achievements, placing the saint in the context of the society from which she emerged, and showing how her public voice and reforming zeal were informed by a private spirituality at all stages of her life.

It explores the relationship between Julian's predicament as a writer who must derive her authority from experience rather than ecclesiastical office and the precise character of her theology as it issues from that predicament; it argues that Julian's mature writing, by integrating notions of creation, incarnation, ecclesiology and personal spirituality in a single coherent vision, achieves a vigorous affirmation of the person as such in the sustaining context of the Church.","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71110931300001451""><strong>Location: Summit libraries</strong></a></p>",https://boydellandbrewer.com/series/studies-in-medieval-mysticism/julian-of-norwich-autobiography-and-theology-hb.html,1999-07-01 00:00,,Boydell Press,"Rochester, NY",,,,978-0-85991-548-9,,,,,,Chistopher,,Abbott,,,,,Anne,Clark,Bartlett,,anne01@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,Rosalynn,,Voaden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/80,9225540,ias_books,1475537775"Studies in Medieval Mysticism, Volume 3: Birgitta of Sweden and the Voice of Prophecy",,"This book examines the religious authority of St Birgitta of Sweden, the charismatic moral reformer and controversial female visionary of the fourteenth century, emphasising both representations of her prophetic mission and debates about her authenticity as a medium of divine revelation. It illuminates Birgitta's view of herself as a prophet of moral reform by explaining how her Revelations depict her religious mission and place in salvation history, going on to reconstruct interactions between Birgitta and her contemporaries, including the significance of her prophetic authority vis-a-vis the priestly authority of her male clerical associates. Finally, it analyses arguments about women's suitability for mediating the divine word in posthumous attacks and defences of her claims to prophesy.Through a close examination of Birgitta's lengthy Revelations, canonization documents, and texts by her posthumous defenders and detractors, this study demonstrates that members of her audience perceived her to be both a vibrant source of supernatural power and a dangerous transgressor of conventional boundaries. Informed by sociological studies of prophetic authority, it contributes to our knowledge of Birgitta herself as well as to our understanding of the dynamics of women's spiritual authority.

This study aims to correct this imbalance by re-examining his English prose works - Ego Dormio, The Commandment and The Form of Living - in terms of their literary form, content and appeal rather than their relationship to Rolle's biography. The author argues that in these devotional works (which appealed to a broad readership in late medieval England) Rolle successfully refines traditional affective strategies to develop an implied reader-identity, the individual soul seeking the love of God, which empowers each and every reader in his or her own spiritual journey.

This study examines the extent to which they make use of such attitudes in their writing, and investigates the importance of the female body as a means of explaining their mystical experiences and the insight gained from them; in both writers, the female body is central to their writing, leading to a feminised language through which they achieve authority and create a space in which they can be heard, particularly in the context of their religious and mystical experiences. The three archetypal representations of woman in the middle ages, as mother, as whore and as ""wise woman"", are all clearly present in the writings of Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe; in examining the ways in which both writers make use of these female categories, McAvoy establishes the extent of their success in resolving the tension between society's expectations of them and their own lived experiences as women and writers.

In the Western scientific tradition, “Environmental Health” is the study of how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. One of the goals of the Native TEACH Project was to find out how Native ways of understanding the world and our place in it might lead to a unique understanding of environmental health – a “NATIVE Environmental Health Science.” To do this, we got input from Tribal college students, staff and faculty from 30 Tribal colleges around the U.S. We did this through a combination of talking circles, interviews, and written surveys administered at the Northwest Indian College and at the 2009 American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) student conference in Missoula, MT. When we sifted through the information we gathered, we identified three core themes that seemed to appear over and over: Community, Wellness, and Inter-Relationship. Each of these core themes contains many rich associations and layers. Each theme can best be understood as a circle. Native Environmental Health Science is the study of how these three circles intersect and overlap, and what this means for our actions as individuals and communities. The Return is an original story based on our research findings. With it, we hope to share the essence of what we learned from the rich conversations we had with Tribal college students, staff and faculty.

Activists and policymakers hope that family-friendly law and policy changes will not only increase women's participation in the workplace, but also help women experience greater workplace equality.

As Christian, political, and social thinkers these men worked in public and behind the scenes to create the landmark Education Act in order to bolster postwar England through appeals to God and country.","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71241608630001451""><strong>Print copy in UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - LC93.G7 S86 2015</strong></a></p>",https://www.amazon.com/God-Country-Butlers-1944-Education/dp/1443883832/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1490915515&sr=1-1&keywords=For+God+and+Country%3A+Butler%27s+1944+Education+Act,2015-12-15 00:00,,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,Newcastle,,,,978-1-4438-8383-2,,,,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71252831560001451,Elizabeth,Libi,Sundermann,,libisun@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/91,9951229,ias_books,1490916983The Psychology of Overeating: Food and the Culture of Consumerism (Korean Edition),,,,,2017-01-01 00:00,,Ruach,"Seoul, Korea",,,,,,,,,,Kima,,Cargill,,kcargill@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/92,9951308,ias_books,1490921186"Food Cults: How Fads, Dogma, and Doctrine Influence Diet",,"What do we mean when we call any group a cult? Defining that term is a slippery proposition – the word cult is provocative and arguably pejorative. Does it necessarily refer to a religious group? A group with a charismatic leader? Or something darker and more sinister? Because beliefs and practices surrounding food often inspire religious and political fervor, as well as function to unite people into insular groups, it is inevitable that ""food cults"" would emerge. Studying the extreme beliefs and practices of such food cults allows us to see the ways in which food serves as a nexus for religious beliefs, sexuality, death anxiety, preoccupation with the body, asceticism, and hedonism, to name a few. In contrast to religious and political cults, food cults have the added dimension of mediating cultural trends in nutrition and diet through their membership. Should we then consider raw foodists, many of whom believe that cooked food is poison, a type of food cult? What about paleo diet adherents or those who follow a restricted calorie diet for longevity? Food Cults explores these questions by looking at domestic and international, contemporary and historic food communities characterized by extreme nutritional beliefs or viewed as ""fringe"" movements by mainstream culture. While there are a variety of accounts of such food communities across disciplines, this collection pulls together these works and explains why we gravitate toward such groups and the social and psychological functions they serve. This volume describes how contemporary and historic food communities come together and foment fanaticism, judgment, charisma, dogma, passion, longevity, condemnation and exaltation.","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71251702220001451""><strong>Print copy in Odegaard Undergraduate Library Stacks - GT2855 .F658 2017</strong></a></p>",https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442251311/Food-Cults-How-Fads-Dogma-and-Doctrine-Influence-Diet,2016-12-01 00:00,,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,Lanham,,,,978-1-4422-5131-1,,,,,,Kima,,Cargill,,kcargill@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/93,9951309,ias_books,1490921190Wilderness Lessons,,"Wilderness Lessons by JM Miller is a love note to the planet that risks burning, a song of loss and connection, and a prayer for being alive and becoming “the animal you were meant to be.” An Eco-poetry book of personal and political honesty, of the violence and elegy of living, this debut collection considers the dissolution of human separateness as a way to create a new space for identity that is fluid—tracing the upwell of violence against people on the fringes of binary constructions and violence against animals and the planet. “Pronoun says the planet is burning,” the poet writes of sun rays and our beating hearts. Written by a poet of tremendous energy, ecstatic imagery, and deeply inherited wisdom, these poems conjure a new understanding of the American poem from JM’s trans-gender, trans-being, howling throat pointed at a sky still brimming with stars.","<p><a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71249059620001451""><strong>Print copy in UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - PS3613.I53853 A6 2016</strong></a></p>",https://www.createspace.com/6450935,2016-08-02 00:00,,FutureCycle Press,"Lexington, KY",,,,978-1-942371-08-3,,,,,,JM,,Miller,,janiem@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/94,9951397,ias_books,1490923650Primitive Elegy,book,,,https://www.etsy.com/shop/alicebluebooks,2015-01-01 00:00,,Alice Blue Books,"Seattle, WA",,,,,,,,,,JM,,Miller,,janiem@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_books/95,9951398,ias_books,1491181783
