The visceral emotions that stem from such debates transcends fact and paves the way for value conflicts over what it means to be an American. For most of our history, one of our most important narratives has been that we are a country that was built by and for immigrants. Indeed, the inscription on the Statue of Liberty reads, in part, ''Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'' For many generations we welcomed new generations of immigrants who added new levels of richness and possibility to our nation. This certainly influenced U.S. policy on the handling of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Yet, at the same time, a coexisting argument threatened this discourse. In this story, America is a country for Americans, and is threatened by ''others''. While this part of the story is certainly not new, it has resurfaced in the wake of September 11th and, even more recently, has become a political tool utilized to serve the interests of those in power.</p><p>The Criminalization of Immigration: Contexts and Consequences explores these competing narratives and the consequences of criminalizing immigration in the United States and abroad. It examines the impact of national, state, and local legislation on the psychosocial well being of immigrants. The book explores key ways in which immigration is criminalized, and examines how the problematization of immigration becomes a political tool.</p><p>Overall, this book provides a complete examination of an issue that cuts through emotional value conflicts. It provides the facts and knowledge essential for a fair and balanced debate.</p>","<a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71206442530001451"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link to book location"">UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - JV6483 .A25 2014</a>",http://amzn.com/1611633567,2013-11-27 00:00,,Carolina Academic Press,"Durham, NC",,,,978-1611633566,,,FALSE,,,Alissa,R.,Ackerman,,ackerma1@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,Rich,,Furman,,rcfurman@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/socialwork_books/3,7412998,socialwork_books,1489099623"Confronting School Bullying: Kids, Culture, and the Making of a Social Problem",book,"<p>Is bullying an innocent part of growing up ... or a serious problem requiring largescale policy remedies?

Utilizing indepth interviews conducted with officials directly involved in averting potential school rampages, this book explores the processes by which threats are assessed and school rampage plots are averted. By examining these averted incidents, this work addresses problematic gaps in school violence scholarship and advances existing knowledge about mass murder, violence prevention, bystander intervention, threat assessment, and disciplinary policy in school contexts.</p>","<a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71153791070001451"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link to book location"">UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - HV8688 .C76 2004</a>",http://amzn.com/1137401656,2014-04-25 00:00,,Palgrave Pilot,"New York, NY",,,<p>Location: UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - LB3013.3 .M33 2014</p>,978-1137401656,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:tacoma:CP71209129640001451,Eric,,Madfis,,emadfis@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/socialwork_books/17,7413015,socialwork_books,1488906732Little Book of Restorative Justice for People in Prison: Rebuilding The Web Of Relationships,book,"<p>Restorative justice, with its emphasis on identifying the justice needs of everyone involved in a crime, is helping restore prisoners' sense of humanity while holding them accountable for their actions.</p><p>Toews, with years of experience in prison work, shows how these practices can change prison culture and society.</p><p>Written for an incarcerated audience, and for all those who work with people in prison, this book also clearly outlines the experiences and needs of this underrepresented part of our society.

Follow the lives of fifty Latina girls living forty miles outside of Los Angeles, California, as they are inadvertently caught up in the schooltoprison pipeline. Their experiences in the connected programs between “El Valle” Juvenile Detention Center and “Legacy” Community School reveal the accelerated fusion of California schools and institutions of confinement. The girls participate in wellintentioned wraparound services designed to provide them with support at home, at school, and in the detention center. But these services may more closely resemble the phenomenon of wraparound incarceration, in which students, despite leaving the actual detention center, cannot escape the surveillance of formal detention, and are thereby slowly pushed away from traditional schooling and a productive life course.</p>","<a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71250039660001451"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link to book location"">UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications -  HV6046 .F55 2016</a>",http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520284883,2016-01-01 00:00,,University of California Press,"Berkeley, CA",,,,978-0520284876,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71250707950001451,Jerry,,Flores,,,jflores3@uw.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/socialwork_books/20,8698207,socialwork_books,1488906734Jazz and Some Sorrow  Selected Early Works: 19911993,book,,,http://www.poetscoop.org/free.htm,2002-01-01 00:00,,Poets' Coop,"Loveland, CO",American poetry,,,,,,FALSE,,,Rich,,Furman,,rcfurman@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/socialwork_books/21,8709860,socialwork_books,1486063453Compañero: Poems,book,,"<a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71251706210001451"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link to book location"">UW Tacoma Library Faculty Publications - PS3556.U7454 C66 2012</a>",http://mainstreetragbookstore.com/?product=companero,2007-01-01 00:00,,Main Street Rag Pub.

This trend, Gibelman believes, may be partially caused by the gap between what practitioners learn in their professional education and what they experience on the job. The vast majority of social workers are employed in organizations, yet they have not been prepared for the realities of the workplace, for the challenges and frustrations of working within a structured environment. Drawing on her experience as a clinician, supervisor, educator, and manager, the author describes strategies to help practitioners improve their ability to work effectively within human service organizations. Navigating Human Service Organizations provides a whole new dimension to their understanding of their chosen career.","<a href=""http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71143003790001451"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link to book location"">UW Tacoma Library Stacks - HV40.

Often because of economic pressures, these individuals continually move through places, countries, and cultures, becoming exposed to unique risk and protective factors. Though migration itself has existed for centuries, the availability of fast and cheap transportation as well as today's sophisticated technologies and electronic communications have allowed transmigrants to develop transnational identities and relationships, as well as engage in transnational activities. Yet despite this new reality, social work has yet to establish the parameters of a transnational social work practice. In one of the first volumes to address social work practice with this emergent and often marginalized population, practitioners and scholars specializing in transnational issues develop a framework for transnational social work practice. They begin with the historical and environmental context of transnational practice and explore the psychosocial, economic, environmental, and political factors that affect atrisk and vulnerable transnational groups. They then detail practical strategies, supplemented with case examples, for working with transnational populations utilizing this population's existing strengths. They conclude with recommendations for incorporating transnational social work into the curriculum.",,http://cupola.columbia.edu/978-0231144483,2010-01-01 00:00,,Columbia University Press,New York,"Social service, Migrant labor  Services for, Immigrants  Services for",,,978-0231526319,,,FALSE,,http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71130625190001451,Nalini,,Negi,,,,,Rich,,Furman,,rcfurman@uw.edu,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/socialwork_books/25,8709864,socialwork_books,1487869219An Experiential Approach to Group Work,book,"An Experiential Approach to Group Work is not your typical group work text!
