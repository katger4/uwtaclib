I focus on the social aspect of how HIV/AIDS is given social stigmas that cause as much suffering as the disease’s physical health effects.  To do this, I apply Erving Goffman’s theory on stigma and analyzing visual images from the early 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s to consider how HIV/AIDS has been constructed and reinforced through time. In considering the historical context I show that each of these images responds to stigma as it existed in the early 1980s but also in the ways that it exists today.',\n",

Of over 2 million people incarcerated in the United States, over half of those imprisoned are Black-Americans. This report examines the \"War on Drugs\" and the policies and practices contributing to increased incarceration rates from a geographical perspective with a focus on Washington State. The research examines if the incarceration rates in the state are lining up with national trends, and the contributing factors. Washington State has a small African-American population of about three percent yet its prison population aligns with national trends with Blacks representing over 25 percent of those incarcerated, 11 times their percentage of the population.  The war has been going on for 30 years and for 30 years prison rates have steadily risen across the country. The \"War on Drugs\" is part of a long sustained pattern of white dominance over Blacks. The war that began in the 1980s is not catching the drug kingpins its intended to. Instead, prisons are filled with many nonviolent low-level offenders with substance abuse problems. Facing cutbacks Washington State offers offenders alternatives to incarceration with treatment as an option, but the policies and practices of the state are not benefitting disenfranchised groups. Through the \"War on Drugs,\" employment, housing, and educational discrimination have been legalized with an already marginalized group suffering the consequences. The War on Drugs has influenced the face of the prison population, and is turning into a legalized formed of discrimination across the country.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Strong sustainability represents a paradigm shift that places environmental conservation and social well-being above the economy and hyper-consumption. Building sustainability requires replacing single-use disposables with durable reusables. This thesis focuses on one ubiquitous single-use disposable - grocery store shopping bags. The environmental science demonstrates that single-use shopping bags, both paper and plastic, incur unnecessary environmental costs because there is a more sustainable alternative in reusable bags. However, in order to pass and enforce successful bag regulations, bag legislation proponents have to garner community support and involvement. Therefore, community-based social marketing (CBSM) is examined as a method to build sustainable behavior in communities. In order to assess the merit of CBSM, a case study was performed at a mid-sized grocery store in Tacoma, Washington. The campaign attempted to decrease single-use shopping bag consumption by increasing reusable shopping bag use through the use of CBSM techniques. Ultimately, CBSM proved successful at changing shopping bag habits and increasing sustainable behavior.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Throughout history, specific periods have been catalysts for significant innovations and ideas that have greatly influenced Western Civilization.  The rediscovery of the Greco-Roman Classics during the Renaissance contributed to the intellectual, political and artistic ideals as well as the aspirations of virtu and the ambition of becoming a \"Renaissance Man\" (Wilcox 1975, Skinner 1978).  The same principles of liberty and the promotion of individuals in the Renaissance were also driving forces behind the American Revolution almost two centuries later (Wood 1992). While much is written on both eras, historians have not made a strong correlation between the similar principles of the two periods.   Through historical analysis, my research explores the importance of the symbiotic relationship of individualism and liberty in the Italian Renaissance and the American Revolution. In relating to the Biblical story of \"David and Goliath,\" the city-state of Florence and the American colonies are connected through specific events, actions, and political circumstances.  My research compares the similar philosophies, political discourses, and religious themes from Renaissance Italy and the American Colonies. Like David in the Bible, Florence--the once great cultural center of Europe--fell into decline and eventually lost its power.  America, however, is still in a moment of time where it is possible to learn, and perhaps change, from these particular examples of history.',\n",

In exploring this question the thesis first examines the political science `rules of the game' that make it extremely difficult for third parties, followed by a historical/sociological comparative analysis of case studies of the Republican and Labour Parties to determine if there are similarities in their rise to power.  The comparative analysis shows that under extreme conditions, a fundamental sociological and demographic change may occur which supports the addressing of issues that the major parties will be unable to adequately incorporate for fear of upsetting their core base supporters.  It is under this context that a third party could ultimately be successful in rising to major party status.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Researchers utilizing quantitative methods have established that sexual violence against Native American women is a severe and persistent problem in Native American communities. Currently, Native American women suffer some of the highest and most violent rates of sexual victimization in the United States; experts estimate that between one-third and one-fourth of Native American women will be sexually victimized in their lifetimes. Researchers conducting qualitative research on sexual violence against Native American women have explained that, not only are Native American women outraged and highly critical of this issue, but that Native American women desire for their perspectives, knowledge, and experiences to be legitimized and validated. Additionally, scholars from a variety of disciplines have also demonstrated that sexual violence against Native American women must be contextualized within the historical and intersecting legacies of colonialism, sexism, racism, and genocide. However, qualitative, interview-based research in the field of sexual violence against Native American women has not been widely pursued and has thus afforded the women whom this issue most affects extremely limited opportunities to speak out about sexual violence in their communities. This research, then, based on feminist methodology and practices, was an effort to fill this gap and prioritize the voices of Native American women. I conducted semi-structured interviews with three Native American women from a tribe in the greater Tacoma area about their perspectives and experiences regarding sexual violence against Native American women in their community. As a result of this research, the overarching argument I make is twofold. I contend that, as researchers, we must make a conscious effort to acknowledge, validate, and legitimize the knowledge Native American women have of colonialism and how it intersects with sexual violence and violent victimizations against Native American women and other community members. In doing so, we can support the activism that is already present in Native American communities and encourage the empowerment of Native American women and community members to continuously deconstruct intersecting oppressions and decolonize their communities.',\n",

This occurred in an area with lagging private investment, and during the Great Recession. I use archival research, interviews, and discourse analysis to investigate this HOPE VI redevelopment process as an instance of actually existing neoliberalism, imbued with local specificities, including regulatory frameworks, political cultures, and housing economies. THA’s promotional literature, and the redevelopment itself produce a particular amalgam of “social justice” and “neoliberal” imaginations and practices that I call “reluctant neoliberalism.” The Tacoma Housing Authority made substantial effort to maximize the amount of low-income housing available through their public/private hybrid neighborhood, and retain property management jobs for their unionized workforce.  However, THA also embraced new roles as a developer, as a shaper of self-sufficient neoliberal subjects, and as a public/private hybrid organization. New (racialized, gendered, and class) meanings of subsidized housing residence and the work of a public housing authority have been produced and materialized.',\n",

I argue that critical scholars focus on praxis in the field itself to see how knowledge (formed and re-formed) might serve to perpetuate or challenge forms of oppression and domination.  I also share some of the unique methodological challenges that arose during my own fieldwork in la Iglesia Ciudad de Refugio in Nagüabo, Puerto Rico.  I offer this to show the indispensability of the methodological praxis for scholarship, for the researcher in the field, and the people being studied. This thesis centers on the development of the methodology of true (reflexive) praxis through an analysis of its application to the (living) field and beyond. My hope is that by examining praxis in the field, scholars can see how they might be contributing to oppressive processes that harm the people who we hope our work might help.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Social media has brought significant changes to all spheres of our social existence, particularly modern activism. While many researchers have analyzed the use of social media in activist movements, there has been little scholarly work on the impacts and implications of social media, particularly as they pertain to language and the values underpinning activism. This thesis seeks to fill this gap in social media studies. Based on the theories of Stuart Hall and Kenneth Burke, it analyzes recent activist movements and social media trends in modern activism through a sociocultural/rhetorical lens. Specifically, within the context of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and the #occupywallstreet movement, this thesis examines the manner in which values and action are both constructed and enacted. I also examine the complex relationship between content and content creators, social media’s influence on production and consumption, and the potential risks social media presents when used as a means for activism. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the sociocultural and rhetorical impacts social media has had in these movements, this thesis aims to highlight the risks of using social media for activism as well as the importance of media literacy to us all.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The purpose of this research is to examine the development and progression of HIV/AIDS stigma within a social structure of power and powerlessness from the early 1980s to the 2010s, through a case study of selected visual images. I focus on the social aspect of how HIV/AIDS is given social stigmas that cause as much suffering as the disease’s physical health effects.  To do this, I apply Erving Goffman’s theory on stigma and analyzing visual images from the early 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s to consider how HIV/AIDS has been constructed and reinforced through time. In considering the historical context I show that each of these images responds to stigma as it existed in the early 1980s but also in the ways that it exists today.',\n",
